    <h1>
        A Case Study of Impairments in Decision-Making & Emotion Recognition
    </h1>
    <p>Decision-making and emotion recognition are both very important things humans need for cognitive function. When
        these two abilities are impaired, they can lead to problems in relationships, social functioning, and even legal
        issues, which affect both individuals and society.</p>
    <p>Impairments in decision making and emotion recognition can result in significant social problems like
        ostracization, a likelihood to engage in criminal behavior, and the development of psychiatric disorders.
        Disorders like antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and psychopathy, in particular, have a high association
        with lack of empathy, impulsivity, and alexithymia (difficulty in recognizing and expressing one’s own
        emotions). All of these symptoms contribute to increased aggression, brutality, and violent conduct, which in
        turn often leads to criminal activity. As a result, these disorders can pose a serious threat not only to the
        individuals themselves but also to society, including legal trouble, social rejection, and mental health issues.
    </p>
    <p>Antisocial personality disorder has been strongly linked to criminal behavior and creates major challenges for
        mental health professionals and society when it comes to understanding, predicting, and treating the disorder.
    </p>
    <p>Psychopathy, which is closely related to antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is also strongly linked to
        criminal behavior, aggression, and developmental issues. It’s influenced by both environmental and genetic
        factors, and most people with psychopathy (about 80–90%) also meet the criteria for ASPD. However, only a
        smaller group of people with ASPD (around 25–40%) are considered to have psychopathy.
    <p>It’s important to understand the underlying factors that contribute to the behavior of individuals with
        psychopathy and ASPD, especially in the context of serious criminal offenses.
