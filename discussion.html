    <h1>Discussion</h1>
    <p>The findings of this study advances our understanding of criminal behavior in individuals with antisocial
        disorder and psychopathy.</p>
    <h2>Contributions to the Literature</h2>
    <h3>Neurocognitive and Emotional Deficits</h3>
    <p> Impaired decision-making (IGT performance) and alexithymia (TAS-20 performance) are both hallmark features of
        convicts with antisocial-personality disorder (ASPD) and psychopathy.
    </p>

        <li>Aligns with Damasio’s Somatic Marker Hypothesis, which suggests that prefrontal dysfunction is linked to
            impulsive-aggressive behavior.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Interestingly, the same convicts scored relatively similar to the healthy control group on the RMET.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            An intact RMET performance with a poor IGT and TAS-20 results pretty much highlights the complexity of
            psychopathy.
        </li>
        <li>While these individuals have the capability to understand others’ emotions cognitively, their inability to
            integrate emotional feedback into decision-making may lead to reckless or even criminal behavior.</li>

    <p>Physical abuse in childhood is strongly associated with ASPD and psychopathy as opposed to emotional or sexual
        abuse.</p>
    <h3>Defense Mechanism
    </h3>
    <p>Primitive defense mechanisms (DSQ), such as denial and projection, having an increased use in the convict group
        supports the notion that maladaptive coping strategies maintain antisocial behavior.

    <h2>Implications for Future Research
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Early Identification of at-risk youth to prevent progression into violent criminality</li>
        <li>Track how childhood trauma, neurocognitive deficits, and criminal outcomes unfold over time.</li>
        <li>Test whether emotion-regulation training or cognitive remediation improves IGT performance.</li>
        <li>Evaluate if trauma-focused therapies can help reduce primitive defense mechanisms in offenders.</li>
        <li>Explore whether psychopathic individuals understand but disregard emotional cues
        </li>
