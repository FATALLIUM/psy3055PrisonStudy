            <td>Assesses unconscious psychological defense mechanisms to understand how individuals cope with stress and
                conflict. Categorizes defenses into primitive (e.g., denial, projection), neurotic (e.g., idealization),
                and mature (e.g., humor, sublimation) (Andrews).</td>
            <td>Designed by Bechara and Damasio in 1944. Evaluates real-world decision-making and impulse control by
                simulating risk-reward scenarios. Participants choose between high-risk/high-reward (decks A/B) and
                low-risk/stable-reward (decks C/D) options.
            </td>
            <td>Gold-standard diagnostic tool for psychopathy, measuring Factor 1 (emotional detachment, grandiosity)
                and Factor 2 (antisocial behavior, impulsivity). A score of 0-8 is deemed very low psychopathy. 9-16 is
                low; 17-24, medium; 25-32, high; 33-40, very high (levels 1-5). Cutoff score in Europe: ≥ 25 = high
                psychopathy
                (Tutuncu et al).
            </td>
            <td>Alexithymia is when a person has difficulty recognizing, expressing, and describing one’s emotions. It
                is not a condition that is classified in DSM-V. Measures emotional processing deficits, specifically
                difficulty identifying, describing, and distinguishing emotions. TAS-20 is scored on a 1-5 point
                (strongly agree to strongly
                disagree) Likert scale. A Likert scale is a rating consisting of a question or statement followed by a
                series of answer questions ranging from one extreme attitude to another (e.g. “Strongly disagree”,
                “Disagree”, “Neutral”, etc). The total score for this test ranges from 20-100 by summing the scores of
                the 20 items in which higher scores indicate more severe alexithymia symptoms (Seo et al).</td>
            <td>Quantifies early-life abuse and neglect across five domains: emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, plus
                emotional and physical neglect. The test also includes 3 questions as a minimization factor to see if
                participants are underplaying or denying their traumatic experiences.
            </td>
            <td>RMET is designed to measure the theory of mind. The theory of mind is the ability to recognize and
                understand another person’s mental state. The test consists of 36 photos, each showing a pair of eyes
                along with 4 choices of words to describe what the person in the picture might be thinking or feeling.
