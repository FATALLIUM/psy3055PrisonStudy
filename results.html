    <h1>Results of the study</h1>
    <p>The study found that while both groups were similar in age and education, the antisocial/psychopathic group had
        more severe criminal backgrounds, higher exposure to physical abuse, greater emotional regulation issues, and
        significantly worse decision-making on behavioral tasks.</p>
    <h3>No major demographic differences between groups:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Age, marital status, and education were similar (p > 0.05)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Significant group differences found in:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Time spent in prison, type/severity of crime, and substance use</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Antisocial/psychopathic group:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Higher rates of substance abuse (p < 0.05)</li>
        <li>Specifically: mixed drug use (52.5%) and cannabis use (17.4%)</li>
        <li>Military service status also differed significantly</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results from tests</h2>

    <img class="image" src=table.png>
    <figcaption>Table of test evaluations</figcaption>

    <h3>On defense styles (DSQ)</h3>
    <p>Antisocial group scored worse across</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mature defenses(p = 0.003)</li>
        <li>Neurotic defenses (p = 0.012)</li>
        <li>Primitive defenses (p = 0.001)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Childhood trauma (CTQ)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Only physical abuse was higher in the antisocial group (p = 0.009)</li>
        <li>No significant differences in emotional abuse, sexual abuse, neglect or total scores</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Alexithymia (TAS-20)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Higher in the antisocial group (p = 0.029)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Psychopathy scores (PCL-R):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Antisocial group scored significantly higher in:
            <ul>
                <li>Interpersonal/affective traits</li>
                <li>Social deviance</li>
                <li>Total score (all p = 0.001)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>No group differences in:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>IQ Scores</li>
        <li>RMET scores (emotion recognition from eyes), across all categories: male, female, positive, negative,
            neutral (p >
            0.05)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Iowa Gambling Task results:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Antisocial group scored lower in:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1st block (p = 0.008)
                </li>
                <li>2nd block (p = 0.032)</li>
                <li>Total earnings (p = 0.009)</li>
                <li>Debt score (p = 0.001)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>PCL-R scores were positively correlated with:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Childhood physical trauma
        </li>
        <li>
            Alexithymia (TAS-20)
        </li>
        <li>
            Defense styles (DSQ)
        </li>
        <li>
            But not with RMET performance
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Some gleaning</h3>
    <p>The results show that the antisocial group displayed more severe emotional and behavioral problems despite the
        fact that two groups were comparable in age, education and marital status. The group were more likely to have a
        history of substance abuse, childhood physical abuse and unhealthy ways of coping.</p>
    <p>Their test results displayed more difficulty in expressing feelings and unhealthy ways of managing emotions. They
        performed worse on decision-making tasks even though their intelligence and ability to recognize emotions were
        about the same as the control group. The findings show that early life experiences and emotional issues may be
        factors in later impulsive and destructive behaviors. </p>
