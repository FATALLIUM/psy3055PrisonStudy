    <h1>Results of the study</h1>
    <p>The study found that while both groups were similar in age and education, the antisocial/psychopathic group had
        more severe criminal backgrounds, higher exposure to physical abuse, greater emotional regulation issues, and
        significantly worse decision-making on behavioral tasks.</p>
    <h3>No major demographic differences between groups:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Age, marital status, and education were similar (p > 0.05)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Significant group differences found in:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Time spent in prison, type/severity of crime, and substance use</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Antisocial/psychopathic group:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Higher rates of substance abuse (p < 0.05)</li>
        <li>Specifically: mixed drug use (52.5%) and cannabis use (17.4%)</li>
        <li>Military service status also differed significantly</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results from tests</h2>

    <h3>On defense styles (DSQ)</h3>
    <p>Antisocial group scored worse across</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mature defenses(p = 0.003)</li>
        <li>Neurotic defenses (p = 0.012)</li>
        <li>Primitive defenses (p = 0.001)</li>
    </ul>
    Childhood trauma (CTQ)
    Only physical abuse was higher in the antisocial group (p = 0.009)
    No significant differences in emotional abuse, sexual abuse, neglect or total scores

    Alexithymia (TAS-20)
    Higher in the antisocial group (p = 0.029)

    Psychopathy scores (PCL-R):
    Antisocial group scored significantly higher in:
    Interpersonal/affective traits
    Social deviance
    Total score (all p = 0.001)
    - No group differences in:
    - IQ Scores
    - RMET scores (emotion recognition from eyes), across all categories: male, female, positive, negative, neutral (p >
    0.05)

    Iowa Gambling Task results:
    Antisocial group scored lower in:
    1st block (p = 0.008)
    2nd block (p = 0.032)
    Total earnings (p = 0.009)
    Debt score (p = 0.001)

    PCL-R scores were positively correlated with:
    Childhood physical trauma
    Alexithymia (TAS-20)
    Defense styles (DSQ)
    But not with RMET performance
